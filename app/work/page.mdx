# Work


On a mission to build software that businesses [love](/projects), and along the way, contribute open-source patterns for the next generation of developers. Here's a summary of my work so far.

## University of Oklahoma

<Small>Information Technology</Small> (23 months)

I joined [OU](https://ou.edu) IT to help build the technological vision of OU's department of physics and astronomy, but I ended up leaving with so much in return. 

This position gave me the freedom to crawl the internet, harvest massive datasets in real-time, and vertically integrate beautiful system dashboards (closed source). 

At this point, I am just one $500 exam away from being a Red Hat (Linux) Certified System Administrator.
